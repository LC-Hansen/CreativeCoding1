<p>In week 2 we worked on a couple small coding things on code.org and also watched a some videos to talk about. Below is what I wrote for those responses, and below that are the certificates of completion for the rest of the assignment.<br><br>
  #The Last Lecture<br>

  The Last Lecture was a masterclass in inspiration and lecture. I thought he was totally engaging and entertaining, but also provided a lot of wisdom and information, and it was a great way to frame my final semester. It was all extremely relatable, I recognized when he said that his wife and kids were much more important than his childhood dreams that he was a wise man who would have a lot of important things to say. People seem to forget this, but to me that is the only thing in the world that matters. Perhaps it is my age, but I am so ready for that part of my life to begin, and the only reason I came back to school after 6 years away was so that I could make the life of my girlfriend and our future children better than the life I had. Without that motivation I truly never would have returned to finish school.<br>

  The brick walls theme was important to me as well. I am hoping to become a real estate appraiser when I leave school and start my own firm at the end of my apprenticeship if I am lucky enough to find one, and that industry is really full of brick walls. Every element from training to confusing and poorly written and designed web sites is put in my way, and it certainly would be daunting for a lot of people, and that continuing theme of brick walls and finding solutions to those problems made me feel okay about being frustrated with the situation because I know that there is a solution out there and if I apply solution based thinking to the problem I will be able to navigate around the brick walls.<br>

  I found a lot of the little tidbits of wisdom to be equally as valuable to me as the overarching thematic elements. The discussion he had with his professor about getting his PhD and teaching was very powerful for me personally. I have always wanted to be a professor since my first day of college, but my life has been dramatically altered through the years and now that is no longer a goal I feel I can accomplish, or perhaps it is no longer a goal I would even want to accomplish. This part of his talk really did give me pause and when his professor said “Go get a PhD, become a professor because you're such a good salesman that any company who gets you is going to use you as a salesman and you might as well be selling something worthwhile like education.” I was very struck by this. It will tumble around my head for a long while after today, because although I know getting a PhD is not really in the cards I still believe I can use my talents to make the world a better place, and perhaps I need to think a little harder to develop a career which will let me do that.<br>

  The Last Lecture was a very personal experience, and it felt more emotional than educational. Dr Pausch made me think about some very deep and overarching themes of life, and I feel very grateful that I got to see that lecture. It gave me a lot to think about, and it inspired me to explore my talents and gifts in order to make the world a better place, but more importantly it reinforced my beliefs that family is the most important thing and that having children is going to be the greatest adventure and work of my life.<br><br>


  #Mindset<br>

  My results from the Mindset Quiz were 0 fixed mindset and 8 growth mindset. I found this fairly surprising because I was sure that I would score fairly even. My assumption about myself was that I believed that there were strong cognitive, culture, or emotional issues which hold a significant minority of people back. I am certain that I have a strong believe in fixed mindsets for a great many people, but at the same time I do believe that there are ways to help each person reach their maximum. Perhaps the thinking I have is a strong believe in social fixed mindset but an equally strong believe in a personal growth mindset. What I mean is that even if society doesn’t value the growth of a person who has a cognitive disability in that there is no incentive or reward or improvement for those individuals I believe that society is simply wrong on this issue and the personal growth is important even if its social results seem miniscule. This relates to the IQ testing that was discussed, I didn't realize that it was designed as a way to change the pedagogy of the time. This particular example reinforced many of the beliefs I have, but ultimately I don't believe in changed my mind significantly. I think there are still strong social issues relating to a fixed or growth mindset, even if I believe that every individual is capable and should strive for growth. Education can be better than it is now, society can be better than it is now, and people can be better than they are now. The problem is how to make each of these line up, without having to rely on the individual brilliance and caring of a few people.<br>
